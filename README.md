## ➲Overview

Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women and the second highest in terms of mortality rates.Diagnosis of breast cancer is performed when an abnormal lump is found (from self-examination or x-ray) or a tiny speck of calcium is seen (on an x-ray). After a suspicious lump is found, the doctor will conduct a diagnosis to determine whether it is cancerous and, if so, whether it has spread to other parts of the body.

This repository contains the code and resources for perbreast cancer using various machine learning approaches. Identified RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier,LogisticRegression,GaussianNB and KNeighborsClassifier are  best predictors with an average accuracy of 95%.

## ➲The Dataset

The dataset contains information related to breast cancer, curated for the purpose of predictive modeling. It comprises six columns capturing crucial attributes associated with breast cancer diagnosis. The target column "diagnosis" which describe  either it is 1 = malignant or 0 = benign.

## ➲Dataset Description
The Data description is as follows:

- diagnosis: The diagnosis of breast tissues (1 = malignant, 0 = benign) where malignant denotes that the disease is harmful

- mean_radius: mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter

- mean_texture: standard deviation of gray-scale values

- mean_perimeter: mean size of the core tumor

- mean_area: mean area of the core tumor

- mean_smoothness: mean of local variation in radius lengths
